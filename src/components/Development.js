        SB Admin 2 makes extensive use of Bootstrap 4 utility classes in order
        to reduce CSS bloat and poor page performance. Custom CSS classes are
        used to create custom components and custom utility classes. Before
        working with this theme, you should become familiar with the Bootstrap
        framework, especially the utility classes.
